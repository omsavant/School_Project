The house cup for winning, the houses must not break rules or points will be taken and points wil be gained by answering questions (only if the answer is right). The third years if want to visit Hogsmead Village, a parent or guardian should sign a form given. The rule breaking may or may not land the student into detension. There is a common room and boys and girls dormitories. The beds are in the boys and girls dormitories. The subject of Astronomy will be taken on a tower for better watching the sky. To enter the dormitories there may be obstacles like you have to say a password gor entering the Gryffindor Common room or you have to answer a riddle to enter Ravenclaw common room. The do's and don'ts wil be told at the starting of the year. This school has 7 years. It startes at the age of 11 if the child will show any magical signs.

    <p>The achievements you can earn are become a prefect of your house (but you can only become one if you don't break minimum rules and if you are entering fifth year). Become a Head Boy or Head girl of your house (only if you are very sincere and secure top marks in all subjects and if you are entering seventh year). There is a choir which is called "The Frog Choir" which you can participate in. You can learn to become an Animagi from age 13 to 16. If you give special services like saving the school from danger or something like that, you can get an award known as "Special Services for the School". If you want to become a teacher at hogwarts, you must excel at the subject you want to teach. Every 50 years there is a "hat stall" it happens when the sorting hat finds it very difficult to sort one into a house. You can be one of those, but this is not guaranteed. Quiddich is the magical world's game. There are 7 players in quiddich. 2 Beaters, 3 Chasers, 1 Keeper and 1 Seeker. You can become any (only if 1 or more places) of these. There is an award if you play the best. You can become the youngest player (not considering the player). There is a tournament called "The Triwizard Tournament" but you can only participate if you are the age of 17. No aging potions will work and nothing can fool the Goblet of Fire. If you are the age of 17 it is not guarenteed that you will be chosen as a champion. Th eGoblet will only choose three participants who will be known as champions. The champions will face many obstacles. There will be three tasks only but the difficulty level will increase. The champion will have to face deathly tasks. Some may even die. The award for winning the Triwizard Tournament is the cup and a 1000 galleons. The one willing to participate will have to write thier name and school name on a piece of parchment paper to put in the Goblet of Fire. The tournament will be held in different schools but the rules and regulations will be the same.
